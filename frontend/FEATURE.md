A FEATURE.md document that describes the final version of your use cases

The three features are as follows:

1. Browse pre-made avatars so to choose a different avatar for your player
2. Browse pre-made maps so to choose a different map for your room
3. Host permissions: only the town creator can upload and use custom maps for the town

Users are able to browse through the avatars in the Player Profile tab, at the bottom left. Simply
open the Player Profile, select View and Update on whichever avatar you wish to have.

Users are also able to browse through pre-made maps and change the town's map. However, only the
town creator, aka the "host" will be able to see those options and change the map.

To select a new map, simply go to the right sidebar, and you will see a list of maps to choose from.
Hit view, and then update but make sure you have the password put in first. The map will render
immiedately.

To upload files for custom map, you would first have to create download our given Basemap JSON file
and given basemap tileset, both linked in the section titled Upload Map. To edit the map, open it
with the Tiled application and make sure you pay special attention to the layers. To upload the map,
simply create a new town and click on the "upload" button and upload the map json file. Once you do
so, you will have to disconnect and rejoin the room, where you will see your uploaded map listed
with the map options.
