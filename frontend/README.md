# Covey.Town Frontend App

Please see the `README.md` in the repository base for information about this project.

This frontend is created using the [create react app](https://create-react-app.dev) toolchain. You
can start a development server by running `npm start`. To create a production build, run
`npm run build`.

To run our app, you will need to pull the code from our GitHub repository:
https://github.com/catuberretta/covey.town to VSCode (do a git clone in your terminal) or any other
code editor of your choice. Running this app locally requires you to run the command npm install (if
itâ€™s your first time) and npm start in both the backend and frontend directories. Please check the
readme for the specific instructions to set up and run. After you have done that, running npm start
will be able to get you to the local host and you can start playing with our features!

Additionally, if you wish to create maps of your own to express your creative interest, you will
need to download Tiled to follow the format of maps we have in Covey Town. Please visit this link:
https://www.mapeditor.org/download.html to download Tiled. To upload your own map, make sure you
download and user our Base Map, located in the Upload map section.
